# Pain vs. Suffering
- All growth comes with some degree of pain, as it pulls you out of your comfort zone. The greater the growth, the greater the pain.
- As you experience pain, seek the remedy! Ask questions that bridge the gap between what you know and what you need to be able to do.
- You’re here because you chose to invest in a different life. A better life.

# About Big O notation:
-----------------------
- We use big-Θ notation to asymptotically bound the growth of a running time to within constant factors above and below.
- Big-O-notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.
- Can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm.
- represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set
- O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set.
- big-Θ notation bounds the running time from both above and below, rather than just from above.

### About Logarithms
- Logarithms are slightly trickier to explain so I'll use a common example:
- Binary search is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value.

## Facts and myths about Python names and values
- This talk is about some fundamental concepts in Python: names and values
- Python is a very approachable language. Often it works just as you expect if you come to it from other languages. But you might suddenly encounter surprising behavior.
- The underlying mechanisms of Python are often quite simple, but their combined effects might not be what you expect. By understanding the mechanisms, you can reason about their effects.
- The local names in the function are drawn in a new frame. Calling the function assigned the actual values to the parameter names, just like any other assignment statement
