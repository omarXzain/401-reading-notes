# Classes and Objects

- Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

## Accessing Object Functions
- To access a function inside of an object you use notation similar to accessing a variable


## Recursive Functions in Python
- Now that we have some intuition about recursion, let’s introduce the formal definition of a recursive function. A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.


## Maintaining State
- When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:

- Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current call’s execution context Keep the state in global scope


## Pesky Details
- Python doesn’t have support for tail-call elimination. As a result, you can cause a stack overflow if you end up using more stack frames than the default call stack depth:

ex:
```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.getrecursionlimit()
3000
```

# Python Testing with pytest
- When you're writing tests, you're rarely going to write just one or two. Rather, you're going to write an entire "test suite", with each test aiming to check a different path through your code. In many cases, this means you'll have a few tests with similar characteristics, something that pytest handles with "parametrized tests".

Summary
If you haven't guessed from my three-part focus on pytest, I've been bowled over by the way this testing system has been designed. After years of hanging my head in shame when talking about testing, I've started to incorporate it into my code, including in my online "Weekly Python Exercise" course. If I can get into testing, so can you. And although I haven't covered everything pytest offers, you now should have a good sense of what it is and how to start using it
